00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,600
As you can see the employmentÂ 
rate for Americans without

00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,840
disabilities is much higher than those

00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,000
with disabilities.

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,920
In general we have seen people with

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,360
disabilities employed at nearly half the rate

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,600
of those without disabilities.
